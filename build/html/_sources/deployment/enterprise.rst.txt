	<h2>Step 5: Connect to your DB and start Pondering üéâ</h2>


In order to connect to your Snowflake account, you need to enter Snowflake connection information and initialize the connection. 


Follow our :doc:`step-by-step guide</resources/SnowflakeInfo>` on how to find your Snowflake connections information.


.. code-block:: python

	import modin.pandas as pd
	import ponder.snowflake
	from ponder.utils.core import Teleporter

	# Create a Ponder Snowflake Connections object
	snowflake_con = ponder.snowflake.connect(
	    user=*****, #your username that you entered during sign up
	    password=*****, #password that you entered during sign up
	    account=*****, #You can find this under ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù > ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù > "Locator" field (You can also find your account in the URL: https://app.snowflake.com/us-west-2/<account-name>/organization, put the <account-name>, not including the URL
	    role=*****, # your access control level. By default this is ‚ÄúACCOUNTADMIN‚Äù.
	    database=*****, # database = ‚ÄúTEST‚Äù or whatever you named the database in Step 1
	    schema=*****,   # schema= ‚ÄúPUBLIC‚Äù,
	    warehouse=***** # warehouse= ‚ÄúCOMPUTE_WH‚Äù
	)

	# Initialize the Snowflake connection
	ponder.snowflake.init(snowflake_con, timeout=1200)


After connecting to your database, you can read a table that exists on your Snowflake account using following command. 

.. code-block:: python

	df= pd.read_sql("TABLE NAME", "auto")
	df


Or you could upload the CSV file to your Snowflake account and read using following commands.

.. code-block:: python

	t = ponder.utils.core.Teleporter()
	t.depulso("test.csv")

.. code-block:: python

	df = pd.read_csv(t.teleported_path("test.csv"), header=0)
	df.head()
