Ponder is a highly scalable Dataframe-as-a-Service that builds on top of Modin, the popular open source technology for running distributed pandas.

With Ponder, data teams no longer have to pull their data out of the warehouse to work with it in pandas. **Ponder’s breakthrough Database Pushdown capability allows users to run pandas** directly *in* the warehouse, meaning that we inherit all the scalability and security benefits of the database, while still preserving the `ease-of-use <https://ponder.io/pandas-vs-sql-part-4-pandas-is-more-convenient/>`_ and `flexibility <https://ponder.io/pandas-vs-sql-part-3-pandas-is-more-flexible/>`_ of pandas. 


With Ponder, your data teams will be able to unleash the power of pandas with:

- **Scale:** Effortlessly transition workflows from prototype to production
- **Speed:** Improve productivity + accelerate developer velocity
- **Security:** Run securely on any infrastructure or inside of your warehouse
- **Reliability:** Monitor dataframe health like any other mission critical system
