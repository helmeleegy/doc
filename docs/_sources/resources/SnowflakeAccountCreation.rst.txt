How to Set up a Snowflake Account?
===============

In this document, we will walk you through how to create a new Snowflake free trial account. 


**Step 1:** Go to `Snowflake sign up page <https://signup.snowflake.com>`_ to enter your information (name, email, company name).

.. note:: 
	This Snowflake account is available to you for 30 days and it gives you $400 worth of free usage credits. You will have access to your Snowflake free trial account until you exceed your $400 credit limit.



**Step 2:** The next step Snowflake will ask you to select Snowflake edition (Standard, Enterprise, and Business Critical) and your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure). 
	
	2-a) Select Enterprise edition 

	.. note:: 
		Enterprise edition has all the crucial features except some data security related features (e.g., HIPAA Compliance).

	2-b) Select AWS as your cloud partner.

	.. note:: 
		Snowflake can be hosted on AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure. Here, we need to choose our cloud partner that our Snowflake will be hosted on.

**Step 3:** After selecting AWS as our cloud provided it will ask us to select the region. This list shows a set of regions where Snowflake is offering it service currently.  In this case, we ``selected US West (Oregon)``, but you can pick any of the available regions.

	.. note:: 
		One very important thing to call out here is that you will not be able to change the selected **service provider** or **region** once the account is created. However, you can update your account to any of the account editions.
